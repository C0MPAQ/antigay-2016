# Antigay-2016

Who doesn't know the problem? You downloaded a zillion of porn torrents, and the shit is all over your harddrive. 

But wait ... what if some of it contained child porn? Then you are a criminal by most countries laws. Anyone could frame you as a gay pedophile if they wanted to. Oh shit! What can you do: encrypt your harddrive. But still, who wants child or gay porn on their computer?

Of course its impossible, to look through +5 million pictures by hand. Here, luckily antigay-2016 can be used to address the issue!


# What you need

- pycaffe and caffe


# Usage

To detect gay shit: 		./antigay-scandir.sh /mnt/1/pix/ -nogay

To detect CP: 			./antigay-scandir.sh /mnt/1/pix/ -nokids

To detect gay shit and CP: 	./antigay-scandir.sh /mnt/1/pix/

Antigay-2016 will generate a HTML report, and you can weed out the pictures in your browser. Execute the shell commands from the textbox to remove the images.


# Drawbacks

Well, the false positive rate is about 80% - so basically Antigay-2016 sucks like fuck and it is hardly usable. 

Though, maybe in the future, better caffe models can be used. Don't miss: Antigay-2017!
